	<p align="center"> Local to the Marble Falls area, I am avaliable to drive out to you and look at your issue usually within the hour.
	I always try to explain the problem and solution as best as I can to you, rather than just solving the problem and leaving.
	My initial diagnostics are always free, and my prices are very transparent. Whether it's needing help with Windows or setting up a printer 
	for your family, my desire is to go the extra mile to ensure the solutions I present are comprehensive and effective.
